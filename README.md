# Heart Disease Prediction Website  

Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction Website! This project leverages **Flask**, **Python**, **HTML**, and **CSS** along with **GitHub Codespaces** to create and host a simple yet effective web application for predicting the likelihood of heart disease.  

This tool provides a user-friendly interface for inputting health parameters and utilizes a machine learning model to predict the probability of heart disease.  

For more details on how we developed the heart disease prediction model, please refer to the following link: https://github.com/SimranS22/Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model-SurTech

## üõ† **Technologies Used**  
- **Flask**: A lightweight and powerful web framework for Python.  
- **Python**: The programming language powering the backend logic and the prediction model.  
- **HTML & CSS**: For creating the web interface with a clean and responsive design.  
- **GitHub Codespaces**: A cloud-powered development environment that simplifies coding and hosting.  
  

## üöÄ **Getting Started with Flask in GitHub Codespaces**  
GitHub Codespaces ‚ô•Ô∏è Flask provides a seamless environment to build and deploy Flask applications without any setup hassle. This project demonstrates how to use these tools to host a website for heart disease prediction.  

### Features  
- **Prediction Model**: Utilizes a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on user inputs.  
- **Flask Framework**: Powers the backend of the application for smooth functionality.  
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Simplifies development and hosting with a ready-to-go workspace.

## üõ† **How to Run This Project**  

1. **Open in GitHub Codespaces**:  
   Clone this project or start a new Codespace from your GitHub repository.  

2. **Set Up Dependencies**:  
   Install the required Python packages (if not already installed):  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

3. **Run the Flask Application**:  
   Use the following command to start the server:  
   ```bash
   flask --debug run
   ```  
   The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.  

4. **Predict Heart Disease**:  
   Enter the required input data in the web interface to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
